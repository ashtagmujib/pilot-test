    <h2>What is Charitok?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      <strong>Charitok ($TOK)</strong> is the worldâ€™s first meme coin that turns
      every transaction into real-world help for underprivileged 
      communities. From food and water to education and rent, we use 
      crypto chaos to create real change.

      <br><br>
      we are on a mission to trun the potential profits from the 
      chaos of the crypto space into something that benefits 
      underdeveloped and underprivileged people and communities

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Every transaction supports real aid via our charity wallet. Here's how it's split:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>4%</strong> to public Charity Wallet</li>
      <li><strong>3%</strong> to Liquidity Pool</li>
      <li><strong>2%</strong> reflections to holders</li>
      <li><strong>1%</strong> dev + operations (capped & transparent)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Charity funds are used based on community votes and are fully tracked on-chain. All donations are documented with receipts and proof-of-help.</p>
